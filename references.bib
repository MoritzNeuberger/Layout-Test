	abstract = {The {DarkSide}-50 direct-detection dark matter experiment is a dual-phase argon time projection chamber operating at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. This paper reports on the blind analysis and spin-independent dark matter-nucleon coupling results from a 532.4 live-days exposure, using a target of low-radioactivity argon extracted from underground sources. The background-free result in the dark matter selection box gave no evidence for dark matter. The present blind analysis sets a 90\% C.L. upper limit on the dark matter-nucleon spin-independent cross section of 1.1E-44 cm{\textasciicircum}2 (3.8E-44 cm{\textasciicircum}2, 3.4E-43 cm{\textasciicircum}2) for a {WIMP} mass of 100 {GeV}/c{\textasciicircum}2 (1 {TeV}/c{\textasciicircum}2, 10 {TeV}/c{\textasciicircum}2).},

The sensitivity strongly relies on the absence of background around the Q-value of the decay. Background coming from 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K, a progeny of 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}Ar, can contribute to that background via electrons from the continuous spectrum with an endpoint at 3.5 {MeV}. Research and development on the suppression methods targeting this source of background were performed at the low-background test facility {LArGe} . It was demonstrated that by reducing 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K ion collection on the surfaces of the broad energy germanium detectors in combination with pulse shape discrimination techniques and an argon scintillation veto, it is possible to suppress 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K background by three orders of magnitude.

Designs covering many square meters with millions of signal channels are now commonplace in high-energy physics and the technology is finding its way into many other fields, ranging from astrophysics to experiments at synchrotron light sources and medical imaging. This book is the first to present a comprehensive discussion of the many facets of highly integrated semiconductor detector systems, covering sensors, signal processing, transistors and circuits, low-noise electronics, and radiation effects. The diversity of design approaches is illustrated in a chapter describing systems in high-energy physics, astronomy, and astrophysics. Finally a chapter "Why things don't work" discusses common pitfalls. Profusely illustrated, this book provides a unique reference in a key area of modern science.},

	abstract = {The Gerda collaboration is performing a sensitive search for neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge{\textasciicircum}\{76\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{Ge\} at the {INFN} Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy. The upgrade of the Gerda experiment from Phase I to Phase {II} has been concluded in December 2015. The first Phase {II} data release shows that the goal to suppress the background by one order of magnitude compared to Phase I has been achieved. Gerda is thus the first experiment that will remain “background-free” up to its design exposure (100 kg year{\textbackslash}hbox \{100 kg\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}hbox \{year\}). It will reach thereby a half-life sensitivity of more than 102610{\textasciicircum}\{26\} year within 3 years of data collection. This paper describes in detail the modifications and improvements of the experimental setup for Phase {II} and discusses the performance of individual detector components.},
